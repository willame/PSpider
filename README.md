# PSpider

A simple spider frame written by Python, which needs Python3.5+

### Features of PSpider
1. Support multi-threading crawling mode (using threading and requests)
2. Support asyncio crawling mode (using aiohttp)
3. Support distributed crawling mode (using redis)
4. Define some utility functions and classes, for example: UrlFilter, make_random_useragent, etc
5. Fewer lines of code, easyer to read, understand and expand

### Modules of PSpider
1. utilities module: define utilities functions and classes for spider
2. insts_async module: define classes of fetcher, parser, saver for asyncio spider
3. insts_thread module: define classes of fetcher, parser, saver for multi-threading spider
4. concurrent module: define WebSpiderFrame of multi-threading spider, asyncio spider and distributed spider

### Procedure of PSpider
1. procedure of multi-threading spider  
![](otherfiles/threads.png)  
①: Fetcher gets url from UrlQueue, and makes request based on this url  
②: Put the result of ① to HtmlQueue, and so Parser can get it  
③: Parser gets item from HtmlQueue, and parses it to get new urls and saved items  
④: Put the new urls to UrlQueue, and so Fetcher can get it  
⑤: Put the saved items to ItemQueue, and so Saver can get it  
⑥: Saver gets item from ItemQueue, and saves it to filesystem or database  

2. procedure of asyncio spider  
Similar with multi-threading spider. The only difference is using "coroutine" instead of "multi-threads".  

3. procedure of distributed spider  
Similar with multi-threading spider. The only difference is getting url from redis instead of queue.  

### Tutorials of PSpider
**Installation: you'd better use the first method**  
（1）Copy the "spider" directory to your project directory, and `import spider`  
（2）Install spider to your python system using `python3 setup.py install`  

**See test.py**
